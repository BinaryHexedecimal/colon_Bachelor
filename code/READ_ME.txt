This repository contains an IPython Notebook file named "colon_st_statistics.ipynb," 
which serves as an application program for reading data and performing calculations for subsequent analysis. 
Additionally, there are five Python files, labeled as "xxxx.py," 
which comprise a library of functions that the "colon_st_statistics.ipynb" notebook can utilize.

To successfully run the notebook, please follow the steps outlined below:


-----------------Prerequisites----------------------

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following:

1. Python installed on your machine.
2. The required Python libraries installed, as specified in the "requirements.txt" file.


-----------------Running the IPython Notebook------------

1. Ensure that the "colon_st_statistics.ipynb" file and the five "xxxx.py" files are located within the same directory.

2. Open the "colon_st_statistics.ipynb" file.

3. In the second cell of the notebook, you have the option to modify certain variables:

dir_: Specify the directory where your data is located and where you would like to save the generated images.
filename_CT: Provide the filename of the CT data you wish to analyze.
filename_st: Enter the filename of the segmentation data you want to use.

4. Execute individual cells in the notebook by clicking on a cell and pressing Shift + Enter, or by selecting "Run" from the toolbar at the top.

Note:

It is crucial to execute the cells in the correct order, as some cells may rely on the output of previous cells.
Please be aware that some cells may take several minutes to run. Be patient and allow them to complete their execution.
